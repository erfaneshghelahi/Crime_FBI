# Project: FBI Crime Data Analysis (2016)
This project analyzes FBI crime statistics for U.S. cities and the District of Columbia for the year 2016. The data is stored in the FBI_CrimeData_2016.json file, where each record represents crime statistics for a specific city. Each cityâ€™s data includes population, number of murders, rapes, robberies, assaults (violent crimes), as well as burglaries, thefts, and vehicle thefts (non-violent crimes). The objective of this analysis is to provide insights into crime patterns across different regions in the U.S.

Objectives:

	1.	Generate a bar chart visualizing the number of murders by region.
	2.	Create a bar chart showing violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, assault) by region.
	3.	Create a bar chart showing non-violent crimes (burglary, theft, vehicle theft) by region.
	4.	Produce a tabular report listing total violent crimes for each state along with the distance from the national mean.
